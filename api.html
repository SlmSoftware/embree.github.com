<h1>Embree API</h1>

<p>The Embree API is a low level ray tracing API that supports
defining and committing of geometry and performing ray queries of
different types. Static and dynamic scenes are supported, that may
contain triangular geometry (including linear motions for motion
blur), instanced geometry, and user defined geometry. Supported ray
queries are, finding the closest scene intersection along a ray, and
testing a ray segment for any intersection with the scene. Single
rays, as well as packets of rays in a struct of array layout can be
used for packet sizes of 1, 4, 8, and 16.</p>

<p>The Embree API exists in a C++ and ISPC version. This document
describes the C++ version of the API, the ISPC version is almost
identical. The only differences are that the ISPC version needs some
ISPC specific uniform type modifiers, and limits the ray packets to the
native SIMD size the ISPC code is compiled for.</p>

<p>The user is supposed to include the <code>embree2/rtcore.h</code>, and the
<code>embree2/rtcore_ray.h</code> file, but none of the other header files. If using
the ISPC version of the API, the user should include
<code>embree2/rtcore.isph</code> and <code>embree2/rtcore_ray.isph</code>.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;embree2/rtcore.h&gt;
#include &lt;embree2/rtcore_ray.h&gt;
</pre></code>

<p>Before invoking any API call, the Embree ray tracing core has to
get initialized through the <code>rtcInit</code> call. Before the
application exits it should call <code>rtcExit</code>. Initializing
Embree again after an <code>rtcExit</code> is allowed.</p>

   <pre><code>rtcInit(NULL);
...
rtcExit();
</pre></code>

<p>The <code>rtcInit</code> call initializes the ray tracing core. An
optional configuration string can be passed through this function to
configure implementation specific parameters. If this string is NULL,
a default configuration is used.</p>

<p>API calls that access geometries are only thread safe as long as
different geometries are accessed. Accesses to one geometry have to
get sequentialized by the application. All other API calls are thread
safe. The <code>rtcIntersect</code> and <code>rtcOccluded</code> calls
are re-entrant, but only for other <code>rtcIntersect</code> and
<code>rtcOccluded</code> calls. It is thus safe to trace new rays when
intersecting a user defined object, but not supported to create new
geometry inside the intersect function of a user defined geometry.</p>

<p>Each user thread has its own error flag in the API. If an error
occurs when invoking some API function, this flag is set to an error
code if it stores no previous error. The <code>rtcGetError</code>
function reads and returns the currently stored error and clears the
error flag again. For performance reasons the ray query functions to
not set an error flag, but fail hard in some circumstances (e.g. if
the user forgot to perform an <code>rtcCommit</code>).</p>

<p>Possible error codes returned by <code>rtcGetError</code> are:</p>

<table>
  <tr><th>Error Code</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>RTC_NO_ERROR</td><td>No error occured.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>RTC_UNKNOWN_ERROR</td><td>An unknown error has occured.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>RTC_INVALID_ARGUMENT</td><td>An invalid argument is specified.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>RTC_INVALID_OPERATION</td><td>The operation is not allowed
 for the specified object.</td>
 <tr><td>RTC_OUT_OF_MEMORY</td><td>There is not enough memory left to
 execute the command.</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Scene</h2>

<p>A scene is a container for a set of geometries of potentially
different types. A scene is created using the <code>rtcNewScene</code>
function call, and destroyed using the <code>rtcDeleteScene</code>
function call. Two types of scenes are supported, dynamic and static
scenes. Different flags specify the type of scene to create and the
type of ray query operations that can later be performed on the
scene. The following example creates a scene that supports dynamic
updates and the single ray <code>rtcIntersect</code> and
<code>rtcOccluded</code> calls.</p>

   <pre><code>RTCScene scene = rtcNewScene(RTC_SCENE_DYNAMIC,RTC_INTERSECT1);
...
rtcDeleteScene(scene);
</pre></code>

<p>Using the following flags the user can select between creating a
static and dynamic scene.</p>

<table>
  <tr><th>Flag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>RTC_SCENE_STATIC</td><td>scene optimized for static geometry</td></tr>
  <tr><td>RTC_SCENE_DYNAMIC</td><td>scene optimized for dynamic geometry</td></tr>
</table>

<p>A dynamic scene is created by invoking <code>rtcNewScene</code>
with the <code>RTC_SCENE_DYNAMIC</code> flag. Different geometries can
now be created inside that scene. Geometries are enabled by
default. Once the scene geometry is specified, an
<code>rtcCommit</code> call will finish the scene description and
trigger building of internal data structures. After the
<code>rtcCommit</code> call it is safe to perform ray queries of the
type specified at scene construction time. Geometries can get disabled
(<code>rtcDisable</code> call), enabled again (<code>rtcEnable</code>
call), and deleted (<code>rtcDeleteGeometry</code> call). Geometries
can also get modified, including their vertex and index arrays. After
the modification of some geometry, <code>rtcModified</code> has to get
called for that geometry. If geometries got enabled, disabled,
deleted, or modified an <code>rtcCommit</code> call has to get invoked
before performing any ray queries, otherwise the effect of the ray
query is undefined.</p>

<p>A static scene is created by the <code>rtcNewScene</code> call with
the <code>RTC_SCENE_STATIC</code> flag. Geometries can only be created
and modified until the first <code>rtcCommit</code> call for the
scene. After that call, each access to any geometry of that static
scene is invalid, including enabling, disabling, modifying, and
deletion of geometries. Consequently, geometries that got created inside a
static scene can only get deleted by deleting the entire static
scene.</p>

<p>The following flags can be used to tune the used acceleration
structure. These flags are only hints and may be ignored by the
implementation.</p>

<table>
  <tr><th>Flag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>RTC_SCENE_COMPACT</td><td>Creates a compact data structure
  by avoiding to use algorithms that consume much memory.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>RTC_SCENE_COHERENT</td><td>Optimize for coherent rays (e.g. primary rays)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>RTC_SCENE_INCOHERENT</td><td>Optimize for in-coherent rays (e.g. diffuse reflection rays)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>RTC_SCENE_HIGH_QUALITY</td><td>Build higher quality spatial data structures.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The following flags can be used to tune the traversal algorithm
that is used by Embree. These flags are only hints and may be ignored
by the implementation.</p>

<table>
  <tr><th>Flag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>RTC_SCENE_ROBUST</td><td>Avoid optimizations that reduce arithmetic accuracy.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The second argument of the <code>rtcNewScene</code> function are
algorithm flags, that allow to specify which ray queries are required
by the application. Calling for a scene a ray query API function that
is different than the ones specified at scene creation time is not
allowed. The application should only pass ray query requirements that
are really needed, to give Embree most freedom in choosing the best
algorithm. E.g. in case Embree implements no packet traversers for some
highly optimized data structure for single rays, then this data
structure cannot be used if the user requires any ray packet
query.</p>

<table>
  <tr><th>Flag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>RTC_INTERSECT1</td><td>Enables the <code>rtcIntersect</code> and <code>rtcOccluded</code> functions for this scene</td></tr>
  <tr><td>RTC_INTERSECT4</td><td>Enables the <code>rtcIntersect4</code> and <code>rtcOccluded4</code> functions for this scene</td></tr>
  <tr><td>RTC_INTERSECT8</td><td>Enables the <code>rtcIntersect8</code> and <code>rtcOccluded8</code> functions for this scene</td></tr>
  <tr><td>RTC_INTERSECT16</td><td>Enables the <code>rtcIntersect16</code> and <code>rtcOccluded16</code> functions for this scene</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Geometries</h2>

<p>Geometries are always contained in the scene they are created
in. Each geometry is assigned an integer ID at creating time, which is
unique for that scene. The current version of the API supports
triangle meshes (<code>rtcNewTriangleMesh</code>), single level
instances of other scenes (<code>rtcNewInstance</code>), and user
defined geometries (<code>rtcNewUserGeometry</code>). The API is
designed in a way that easily allows adding new geometry types in
later releases.</p>

<p>For dynamic scenes, the assigned geometry IDs fulfill the following
properties. As long as no geometry got deleted, all IDs are assigned
sequentially, starting from 0. If geometries got deleted, the
implementation will reuse IDs later on in an implementation dependent
way. Consequently sequential assignment is no longer guaranteed, but a
compact range of IDs. These rules allow the application to manage a
dynamic array to efficiently map from geometry IDs to its own geometry
representation.</p>

<p>For static scenes, geometry IDs are assigned sequentially starting
at 0. This allows the application to use a fixed size array to map
from geometry IDs to its own geometry representation.</p>

<h3>Triangle Meshes</h3>

<p>Triangle meshes are created using the
<code>rtcNewTriangle</code> mesh function call, and potentially
deleted using the <code>rtcDeleteGeometry</code> function call.</p>

<p>The number of triangles, number of vertices, and number of time
steps (1 for normal meshes, and 2 for linear motion blur), have to get
specified at construction time of the mesh. The user can also specify
additional flags that choose the strategy to handle that mesh in
dynamic scenes. The following example creates a triangle mesh with
some geometry flags, numTriangle trangles numVertices vertices and no
motion blur:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned geomID = rtcNewTriangleMesh(scene,flags,numTriangles,numVertices,1);</pre></code>

<p>The following geometry flags can be specified at construction time of
the triangle mesh:</p>

<table>
  <tr><th>Flag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>RTC_GEOMETRY_STATIC</td><td>The mesh is considered static
  and should get modified rarely by the application.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>RTC_GEOMETRY_DEFORMABLE</td><td>The mesh is considered
  to deform in a coherent way, e.g. a skinned character. The
  implementation is free to choose a BVH refitting approach for
  handling meshes tagged with that flag.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>RTC_GEOMETRY_DYNAMIC</td><td>The mesh is considered highly
  dynamic and changes frequently and in an unstructured way. For
  dynamic scenes the implementation will rebuild data structures from
  scratch for this type of mesh.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The triangle indices can be set by mapping and writing to the index
buffer (<code>RTC_INDEX_BUFFER</code>) and the triangle vertices can
be set by mapping and writing into the vertex buffer
(<code>RTC_VERTEX_BUFFER</code>). The index buffer contains an array
of three 32 bit indices, while the vertex buffer contains an array of
3 float values aligned to 16 bytes. All buffers have to get unmapped
before an <code>rtcCommit</code> call to the scene.</p>

<pre><code>struct Vertex   { float x,y,z,a; };
struct Triangle { int v0, v1, v2; };

Vertex* vertices = (Vertex*) rtcMapBuffer(scene,geomID,RTC_VERTEX_BUFFER);
// fill vertices here
rtcUnmapBuffer(scene,geomID,RTC_VERTEX_BUFFER);

Triangle* triangles = (Triangle*) rtcMapBuffer(scene,geomID,RTC_INDEX_BUFFER);
// fill triangle indices here
rtcUnmapBuffer(scene,geomID,RTC_INDEX_BUFFER);
</pre></code>

<p>A triangle mesh with linear motion blur support is created by
setting the number of time steps to 2 at mesh construction
time. Specifying a number of time steps larger than 2 is invalid. For
a triangle mesh with linear motion blur, the user has to set the
<code>RTC_VERTEX_BUFFER0</code> and <code>RTC_VERTEX_BUFFER1</code>
vertex arrays, one for each time step. If a scene contains triangle
meshes with linear motion blur, the user has to set the
<code>time</code> member of the ray to a value in the range [0,1]. The
ray will intersect the scene with the vertices of the two time steps
linearly interpolated to this specified time. Each ray can specify a
different time, even inside a ray packet.</p>

<p>A 30 bit geometry mask can be assigned to triangle mesh geometries
using the <code>rtcSetMask</code> call.</p>

<pre><code>rtcSetMask(scene,geomID,mask);</pre></code>

<p>Only if the bitwise and operation of this mask with the mask stored
inside the ray is not 0, triangles of this mesh are hit by a ray. This
feature can be used to disable selected triangle meshes for
specifically tagged rays, e.g. to disable shadow casting for some
geometry. This API feature is disabled in Embree by default at compile
time, and can be enabled in cmake through the
<code>RTCORE_ENABLE_RAY_MASK</code> parameter.</p>

<p>See tutorial00 for an example of how to create triangle meshes.</p>

<h3>User Defined Geometry</h3>

<p>User defined geometries make it possible to extend Embree by adding
arbitrary types of geometry to the scene. This is achieved by
providing for each such user geometry a bounding box as well as user
defined intersect and occluded functions. When performing ray queries
on a scene containing user geometries, Embree will invoke these user
functions to test rays for intersection with the user defined
geometry. A user provided data pointer, that points to a user specific
representation of the geometry, is also passed to each user function
invokation. As Embree supports different ray packet sizes, one
potentially has to provide different versions of user intersect and
occluded function pointers for these packet sizes. However, the ray
packet size of the called user function always matches the packet size
of the originally invoked ray query function. Consequently, an
application only operating on single rays, also only has to provide
single ray intersect and occluded function pointers. </p>

<p>User geometries are created using the
<code>rtcNewUserGeometry</code> function call, and potentially deleted
using the <code>rtcDeleteGeometry</code> function call. The folling
example illustrates creating a user geometry:</p>

<pre><code>void userIntersectFunction(void* userGeom, RTCRay& ray) {
  if (ray misses userGeom) return;
  update ray hit information;
}

void userOccludedFunction(void* userGeom, RTCRay& ray) {
  if (ray misses userGeom) return;
  geomID = 0;
}

...

unsigned geomID = rtcNewUserGeometry(scene);
rtcSetBounds(scene,geomID,lower_x,lower_y,lower_z,upper_x,upper_y,upper_z);
rtcSetUserData(scene,geomID,userGeom);
rtcSetIntersectFunction(scene,geomID,&userIntersectFunction);
rtcSetOccludedFunction (scene,geomID,&userOccludedFunction);</pre></code>

<p>The user intersect function (userIntersectFunction) get as input
the pointer provided through the <code>rtcSetUserData</code> function
call, and the ray to test the geometry for intersection with. If the
user geometry is missed, the function should return without modifying
the ray structure. If the geometry is hit, the hit information of the
ray (tfar,u,v,Ng,geomID,primID) have to get updated.</p>

<p>The user occluded function (userOccludedFunc) get as input the
pointer provided through the <code>rtcSetUserData</code> function
call, and the ray for the occlusion test. If the user geometry is
missed, the function should return without modifying the ray
structure. If the geometry is hit, the geomID member of the ray should
get set to 0.</p>

<p>Is is supported to invoke the <code>rtcIntersect</code> and
<code>rtcOccluded</code> function calls inside such user functions. It
is not supported to invoke any other API call inside these user
functions.</p>

<p>See tutorial02 for an example of how to use the user defined
geometries.</p>

<h3>Instances</h3>

<p>Embree supports instancing of scenes inside another scene using some
transformation. As the instanced scene is stored only a single time,
even if instanced to multiple locations, this feature can be used to
create extremely large scenes. Only single level instancing is
supported by Embree natively, however, multi-level instances can
principally be implemented through user geometries.</p>

<p>Instances are created using the <code>rtcNewInstance</code>
function call, and potentially deleted using the
<code>rtcDeleteGeometry</code> function call. To instantiate a scene,
one first has to generate the scene B to instantiate. Now one can add
an instance of this scene inside a scene A the following way:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned instID = rtcNewInstance(sceneA,sceneB);
rtcSetTransform(sceneA,instID,RTC_MATRIX_COLUMN_MAJOR,&column_matrix_3x4);
</pre></code>

<p>One has to call <code>rtcCommit</code> on scene B before one calls
<code>rtcCommit</code> on scene A. Providing a bounding box is not
required and also not allowed. If a ray hits the instance, then the
geomID and primID members of the ray are set to the geometry ID and
primitive ID of the primitive hit in scene B, and the instID member of
the ray is set to the instance ID returned from the
<code>rtcNewInstance</code> function.</p>

<p>The <code>rtcSetTransform</code> call can be passed an affine
transformation matrix with different data layouts:</p>

<table>
  <tr><th>Layout</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>RTC_MATRIX_ROW_MAJOR</td><td>The 3x4 float matrix is layed out in row
  major form.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>RTC_MATRIX_COLUMN_MAJOR</td><td>The 3x4 float matrix is layed out
  in column major form.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>RTC_MATRIX_COLUMN_MAJOR_ALIGNED16</td><td>The 3x4 float matrix is
  layout out in column major form, with each column padded by an
  additional 4th component.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Passing homogenous 4x4 matrices is possible as long as the last row
is (0,0,0,1). If this homogenous matrix is layed out in row major
form, use the <code>RTC_MATRIX_ROW_MAJOR</code> layout. If this
homogenous matrix is layed out in column major form, use the
<code>RTC_MATRIX_COLUMN_MAJOR_ALIGNED16</code> mode. In both cases,
Embree will ignore the last row of the matrix.</p>

<p>See tutorial04 for an example of how to use instances.</p>

<h2>Ray Queries</h2>

<p>The API supports finding the closest hit of a ray segment with the
scene (<code>rtcIntersect</code> functions), and determining if any hit between a
ray segment and the scene exists (<code>rtcOccluded</code> functions).</p>

<p>The ray layout to be passed to the ray tracing core is defined in the
<code>embree2/rtcore_ray.h</code> header file. It is up to the user if
he wants to use the ray structures defined in that file, or resemble
the exact same binary data layout with their own vector classes. The
ray layout might change with new Embree releases as new features get
added, however, will stay constant as long as the major release number
does not change.</p>

<p>The ray contains the following data members (in SOA layout for ray
packets):</p>

<table>
  <tr><th>Member</th><th>In/Out</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>org</td><td>in</td><td>ray origin</td></tr>
  <tr><td>dir</td><td>in</td><td>ray direction (can be unnomalized)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>tnear</td><td>in</td><td>start of ray segment</td></tr>
  <tr><td>tfar</td><td>in/out</td><td>end of ray segment, set to hit distance after intersection</td></tr>
  <tr><td>time</td><td>in</td><td>time used for motion blur</td></tr>
  <tr><td>mask</td><td>in</td><td>ray mask to mask out geometries</td></tr>

  <tr><td>Ng</td><td>out</td><td>not normalized geometry normal</td></tr>
  <tr><td>u</td><td>out</td><td>barycentric u-coordinate of hit</td></tr>
  <tr><td>v</td><td>out</td><td>barycentric v-coordinate of hit</td></tr>
  <tr><td>geomID</td><td>out</td><td>geometry ID of hit geometry</td></tr>
  <tr><td>primID</td><td>out</td><td>primitive ID of hit primitive</td></tr>
  <tr><td>instID</td><td>out</td><td>instance ID of hit instance</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Note that the <code>tfar</code> member functions as an input and
output.</p>

<p>In the ray packet mode (with packet size of N), the user has to
provide a pointer to N 32 bit integers that act as a ray activity
mask. If one of these integers is set to 0x00000000 the corresponding
ray is considered inactive and if the integer is set to 0xFFFFFFFF,
the ray is considered active. Rays that are inactive will not update
any hit information. Data alignment requirements for ray query functions
operating on single rays is 16 bytes for the ray. Data alignment
requirements for query functions operating on AOS packets of 4, 8, or
16 rays, is 16, 32, and 64 bytes respectively, for the valid mask and
the ray. To operate on packets of 4 rays, the CPU has to support SSE,
to operate on packets of 8 rays, the CPU has to support AVX-256, and
to operate on packets of 16 rays, the CPU has to support the AVX-512
instructions. Additionally, the required ISA has to be enabled at
Embree compile time, to use the desired packet size.</p>

<pre><code>void rtcIntersect   (                   RTCScene scene, RTCRay& ray);
void rtcIntersect4  (const void* valid, RTCScene scene, RTCRay4& ray);
void rtcIntersect8  (const void* valid, RTCScene scene, RTCRay8& ray);
void rtcIntersect16 (const void* valid, RTCScene scene, RTCRay16& ray);
void rtcOccluded    (                   RTCScene scene, RTCRay& ray);
void rtcOccluded4   (const void* valid, RTCScene scene, RTCRay4& ray);
void rtcOccluded8   (const void* valid, RTCScene scene, RTCRay8& ray);
void rtcOccluded16  (const void* valid, RTCScene scene, RTCRay16& ray);
</pre></code>

<p>Finding the closest hit distance is done through the
<code>rtcIntersect</code> functions. These get the activity mask, the
scene, and a ray as input. The user has to initialize the ray origin
(org), ray direction (dir), and ray segment (tnear, tfar). The ray
segment has to be in the range [0,inf], thus ranges that start behind
the ray origin are not valid, but ranges can reach to infinity. The
geometry ID (geomID member) has to get initialized to
INVALID_GEOMETRY_ID (-1). If the scene contains instances, also the
instance ID (instID) has to get initialized to INVALID_GEOMETRY_ID
(-1). If the scene contains linear motion blur, also the ray time
(time) has to get initialized. If ray masks are enabled at compile
time, also the ray mask (mask) has to get initialized. After tracing
the ray, the hit distance (tfar), geometry normal (Ng), local hit
coordinates (u,v), geometry ID (geomID), and primitive ID (primID) are
set. If the scene contains instances, also the instance ID (instID) is
set, if an instance is hit. The geometry ID corresponds to the ID
returned at creation time of the hit geometry, and the primitive ID
corresponds to the nth primitive of that geometry, e.g. nth
triangle. The instance ID corresponds to the ID returned at creation
time of the instance.</p>

<p>The following code properly sets up a ray and traces it through
the scene:</p>

<pre><code>RTCRay ray;
ray.org = ray_origin;
ray.dir = ray_direction;
ray.tnear = 0.0f;
ray.tfar = inf;
ray.geomID = INVALID_GEOMETRY_ID;
ray.primID = INVALID_GEOMETRY_ID;
ray.instID = INVALID_GEOMETRY_ID;
ray.mask = 0xFFFFFFFF;
ray.time = 0.0f;
rtcIntersect(scene,ray);
</pre></code>

<p>Testing if any geometry intersects with the ray segment is done
through the <code>rtcOccluded</code> functions. Initialization has to
be done as for <code>rtcIntersect</code>. If some geometry got found
along the ray segment, the geometry ID (geomID) will get set to 0. No
other member of the ray will get modified.</p>

<p>See tutorial00 for an example of how to trace rays.</p>
