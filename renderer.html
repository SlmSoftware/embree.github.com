<h1>Photo-Realistic Example Renderer</h1>

<p>The Embree Example Renderer is a photo-realistic renderer that
builds on the Embree high performance ray tracing kernels. The
renderer is used to demonstrate how Embree is used in practice and to
measure Embree's performance in a realistic application scenario. The
Embree Example Renderer is not a full featured renderer and not
designed to be used for production renderering. The Embree Example
Renderer is released as Open Source under the <a
 href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0
license</a>.</p>
      
<p>In ealier versions of Embree this photo-realistic renderer was part
of the Embree kernel repository. In fact, this path tracer was
initially rather tightly coupled to the Embree kernels, and has over
time evolved into something that eventually became bigger than the
kernels themselves.</p>

<p>In the process of re-focusing Embree on the actual kernels (that
most users' interest is in) and to make it easier to use the kernels
without having to understand the whole project, starting in version
2.1 we have created a stricter separation between the actual kernels
and the sample codes that use those kernels.</p>

<p>Consequently, we have moved the Embree Example Renderer into a
separate repository dedicated to this renderer. This path tracer is
still being maintained, and is still kept in sync with the Embree
kernels; but it has to be checked out and built separately from the
kernels.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The example renderer is only available in source form and can be
downloaded using the following ZIP file:</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/embree/embree-renderer/archive/v2.1_alpha.zip">embree-renderer-2.1-alpha.zip</a></p>

<p>Alternatively you can also use git to get the latest Embree Example
Renderer 2.1:</p>
      
<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/embree/embree-renderer.git embree-renderer
$ cd embree-renderer
$ git checkout v2.1</code></pre>
      
<h2>Compiling under Windows</h2>

<p>For compilation under Windows you first have to install the Embree
ray tracing kernels including the Intel SPMD Compiler (ISPC). After
installation you have to set the EMBREE_INSTALL_DIR environment
variable to the root folder of Embree.</p>

<p>Use the Visual Studio 2008 solution file to compile the Embree
Example Renderer. The solution file will automatically get converted
in case you use new versions of Visual Studio. Inside Visual Studio
you can switch between the Microsoft Compiler and the Intel Compiler
by right clicking on the solution and then selecting the compiler. The
project compiles with both compilers in 32 bit and 64 bit mode. We
recommend using 64 bit mode and the Intel Compiler for best
performance.</p>

<p>By default, the solution file requires ISPC to be installed
properly. For compiling the solution without ISPC, simply delete the
device_ispc project from the solution file.</p>

<h2>Compiling under Linux and MacOS</h2>

<p>To compile the Embree Example Renderer using CMake create a build
directory and execute "ccmake .." inside this directory.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir build
cd build
ccmake ..</pre></code>

<p>This will open a configuration dialog where you should set the build
mode to “Release” and the compiler to either GCC, CLANG, or ICC. You can
configure which parts of the Embree Example Renderer to build:</p>

<table>
  <tr><td>BUILD_SINGLE_RAY_DEVICE</td><td>Single ray device for CPU operating on single rays.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>BUILD_SINGLE_RAY_DEVICE_KNC</td><td>Single ray device for Xeon Phi&trade; operating on single rays.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>BUILD_ISPC_DEVICE</td><td>ISPC CPU device operating on ray packets of size 4 (SSE) or 8 (AVX).</td></tr>
  <tr><td>BUILD_ISPC_DEVICE_KNC</td><td>ISPC device for Xeon Phi&trade; accelerator operating on ray packets of size 16</td></tr>
  <tr><td>BUILD_NETWORK_DEVICE</td><td>Network device to render on render server</td></tr>
</table>
  
<p>When enabling any ISPC renderer, you also have to install ISPC. If
you select BUILD_ISPC_DEVICE, you should select which instructions
sets to enable for ISPC (TARGET_SSE2, TARGET_SSE41, TARGET_AVX, and
TARGET_AVX2).</p>

<p>All target ISAs you select when compiling the Embree Example
Render, have also to be enabled when compiling Embree. Due to some
limitation of ISPC you have to enable more than one target ISA if you
also enabled more than one target ISA when compiling Embree, otherwise
you will get link errors.</p>

<p>If you installed Embree, CMake will find it automatically and set
the EMBREE_INCLUDE_PATH and EMBREE_LIBRARY variables.</p>

<p>If you do not want to install Embree on your system some additional
configurations are required to use Embree from its build folder. Set
the EMBREE_INCLUDE_PATH to the embree_root_directory/include folder and the
EMBREE_LIBRARY to embree_root_directory/build/libembree.2.1.0.dylib for
MacOS or embree_root_directory/build/libembree.so.2.1.0 for Linux. Under
Linux you have to additionally add embree_root_directory/build to your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH. This last step is not required under MacOS.</p>

</p>Press c (for configure) and g (for generate) to generate a Makefile
and leave the configuration. The code can now be compiled by executing
make. The executables will be generated in the build folder.</p>

<pre><code>make</pre></code>

<h2>Using the Embree Example Renderer</h2>

<p>The example renderer also ships with a few simple test scenes, each
consisting of a scene file (.xml or .obj) and a command script file
(.ecs). The command script file contains command line parameters that
set the camera parameters, lights and render settings. The following
command line will render the Cornell Box scene with 16 samples per
pixel and write the resulting image to the file cornell_box.tga in the
current directory:</p>

<pre><code>./renderer -c ../models/cornell_box.ecs -spp 16 -o cornell_box.tga</code></pre>

<p>To interactively display the same scene, enter the following command:</p>

<pre><code>./renderer -c ../models/cornell_box.ecs</code></pre>

<p>A window will open and you can control the camera using the mouse and
keyboard. Pressing c in interactive mode outputs the current camera
parameters, pressing r enables or disables the progressive refinement
mode.</p>

<p>By default the renderer uses the single ray device. For selecting a
different device use the -device command line parameter at the very 
beginning:</p>

<pre><code>./renderer -device singleray -c ../models/cornell_box.ecs
./renderer -device ispc -c ../models/cornell_box.ecs

./renderer -device singleray_xeonphi -c ../../models/cornell_box.ecs
./renderer -device ispc_xeonphi -c ../../models/cornell_box.ecs
</code></pre>

<h3>Network Mode</h3>

<p>For using the network device start the render server on some machine:</p>

<pre><code>renderer_server</code></pre>

<p>Make sure that port 8484 is not blocked by the firewall. Now you can 
connect from a second machine to the network server:</p>

<pre><code>renderer -connect ip_of_network_server -c ../../models/cornell_box.ecs</code></pre>
  
<h3>Navigation</h3>

<p>The navigation in the interactive display mode follows the camera
orbit model, where the camera revolves around the current center of
interest. The camera navigation assumes the y-axis to point
upwards. If your scene is modelled using the z-axis as up axis we
recommend rotating the scene.</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Left Mouse Button</dt> <dd>Rotate around center of interest</dd>
    <dt>Middle Mouse Button</dt> <dd>Pan</dd>
    <dt>Right Mouse Button</dt> <dd>Dolly (move camera closer or away from center of interest)</dd>
    <dt>Strg+Left Mouse Button</dt> <dd>Pick center of interest</dd>
    <dt>Strg+Shift+Left Mouse Button</dt> <dd>Pick focal distances</dd>
    <dt>Alt+Left Mouse Button</dt> <dd>Roll camera around view direction</dd>
    <dt>L Key</dt> <dd>Decrease lens radius by one world space unit</dd>
    <dt>Shift+L Key</dt> <dd>Increase lens radius by one world space unit</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Example Models</h2>
