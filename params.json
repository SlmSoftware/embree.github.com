The kernels are optimized for photo-realistic rendering on the latest IntelÂ© processors with support for the SSE and AVX instruction sets. In addition to the ray tracing kernels, Embree provides an example photo-realistic rendering engine. Embree is designed for Monte Carlo ray tracing algorithms, where the vast majority of rays are incoherent. The specific single-ray traversal kernels in Embree provide the best performance in this scenario and they are very easy to integrate into existing applications.\r\n\r\n### What's New in Embree 1.1?\r\nEmbree 1.1 offers new acceleration structures with significantly lower memory consumption: up to 2x during rendering and up to 3x during construction. In addition, the new builders are up to twice as fast as the previous version. To better support movie production rendering, Embree 1.1 adds a new acceleration structure for scenes with motion blur, support for very large models, and improved ray/triangle intersection accuracy.\r\n\r\n### Downloading Embree\r\n\r\nThe Embree source code can be downloaded directly via git:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone embree.github.com/embree.git embree\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Embree Resources\r\n\r\nRead Article: [Embree: Photo-Realistic Ray Tracing Kernels](http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/embree-highly-optimized-visibility-algorithms-for-monte-carlo-ray-tracing)\r\n\r\nDownload Crown Scene: [Crown.zip (74MB)](http://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/article/183323/crown.zip)\r\n\r\nParticipate in Embree Forum Discussion: [Embree Forum](http://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/embree-photo-realistic-ray-tracing-kernels)\r\n\r\nBlog Post: [Can't wait to create photo-realistic images for free?](http://blogs.intel.com/research/2011/07/cant_wait_to_create_photo-real.php)\r\n\r\n### Embree Support or Contact\r\nFor questions and bug reports please write us at embree_support@intel.com.
